# Culinary Companion

This project is an Android application called **Culinary Companion**.  
It was developed as part of my coursework to practice creating an app that allows users to save and organise their favourite recipes.

The app makes it easy to create, edit, and delete recipes, and everything is saved locally so nothing gets lost when the app closes

## **Create Recipes**
Users can create a recipe entry with a title, ingredients list, instructions, and a category (Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch, Dinner, Desserts, Other).

**Edit and Delete**  
  Existing recipes can be updated or removed from the app at any time.

**Organise by Category**  
  Recipes are grouped by category to make them easier to find.

**Persistent Storage**  
  Data is stored locally using a Room database so recipes stay saved across restarts.

**Compose User Interface**  
  All screens are built using Jetpack Compose with a clean and simple layout.

**Unit Testing**  
  The project includes unit tests for the RecipeDao to verify insert, update, delete, and retrieve operations.
